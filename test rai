Client Sync is a flexible and powerful data-transfer solution that allows technical personnel to build
clients in non-production SAP environments. Client Sync is part of the Data Sync Manager™ (DSM)
suite, which has five complementary products: Object Sync™ , Client Sync™ , Data Secure™, System
Builder™ and System Compare™ .  Object Sync allows you to transfer business objects easily and
accurately, providing you with reliable test data when you need it.  Client Sync offers high-performance client copying using a table-oriented approach.  Data Secure protects your sensitive
data by providing in-place and integrated masking for other DSM products.  System Builder allows
you to build a new system shell quickly, so you can add object and client data as you need it. 
System Compare allows you to easily identify system differences in the SAP repository. 1.1 Why use
Client Sync? Companies using SAP® need to transfer data between clients and systems for
production development and support or to refresh training clients. Without an adequate transfer
solution, client copies can be timeconsuming and require a lot of storage space. You also risk
exposing sensitive data, and transactional flows may be incomplete. With Client Sync, you can create
testing or training clients quickly and easily by selecting the time slice of data you need and/or data
for certain company codes (with the option to exclude large or sensitive data sets, such as all the
employee data from the HCM module). You can also decide whether or not to transfer client-
independent or client-dependent customization, authorizations, and user masters. Related
transactional data can also be included so that document flows are complete. Client Sync not only
eliminates system downtime during copies, but also ensures the integrity of the data. Additional
functionality allows you to extend delivered business objects and create new customer-defined
business objects. All delivered business objects adhere to the standard SAP authorizations. As a
result, Client Sync allows you to create consistent clients easily with just the data you need, when
you need it, saving time and space and thus reducing costs. 1.2 How Client Sync works Client Sync
has a highly intuitive and user-friendly GUI that helps you slice and transfer SAP application data
between clients. A roadmap will lead you through the Sync or import process, allowing you to see
exactly which phase you’re in. In the process, you can use pre-defined profiles to select and mask a
specific client subset and control the data transfer using various processing and scheduling options.
You can also monitor and perform actions on currently executing Syncs in the Monitor Desk, and
DSM will keep you updated via email or SMS if you set up notifications. Other useful features include
estimation runs (which allow you to determine how much space you need on the target client before
executing the transfer) and templates (which reduce the time it takes to create a Sync). Client Sync
has four authorization templates to ensure stringent control and security within the product: 
Administrator (who can configure the product)  Control Center Administrator (who can access the
Administration Desk and Control Center)  Content Developer (who can create and enhance
business objects)  User (who can execute Syncs). For more information about authorizations, see
Appendix D. For a glossary of key Client Sync concepts, refer to Important DSM5 terms on our Client
Central support portal. Client Sync is available for SAP® ERP (including S/4 HANA), SRM, CRM, GTS,
BW, SCM, Bank Analyzer and NetWeaver. Refer to SAP releases and languages supported by DSM5
on our Client Central support portal for more information. 1.3 Structure of this guide This guide is
