Ticket 1 Info request #54200 - Question about available transactions
I have attached a list of transactions that are available. I would like to understand what they all are in better detail. Some appear to be duplicates and it appears that maybe your company is trying to move toward more generic transactions instead of linking them to versions (like /USE/DSM3)
I searched my manuals for more details and was not able to find that information. This will be very useful because we have taken your default foundation roles and built our roles and we want to keep them current.
For example: What is the difference between /USE/DSM and /USE/DSM3

Dear
You are correct that we did indeed move towards generic transactions codes and removed the version (3) from them but we still included them as we need to support those customers who are used to using the older DSM3 transaction codes even though they may have moved to DSM4, e.g /USE/DSM3, /DSM3OD and /USE/DSM will all invoke DSM 4 Object Sync.
The transactions with LT are used by EPI-USE Labs Services personnel for System Landscape Optimization projects where they need to perform their Landscape Transformation activities .
Are their specific transaction codes in the spreadsheet where the Transaction Text is not sufficient and you require more information for?
Thanks and regards

I would like to understand which ones are identical
I also did try to update our roles correctly. For example: We tried to execute a data transfer after removing the DSM3 transactions. When we tried to execute DSM and process an action to bring down data this happens
"You are not authorized to use transaction /USE/DSM3_MON "
I either have to include all transactions or is this something that can be fixed in the code we have?

Ticket 2: Info request #141196 - Add Role to user
Hi Support
I received the following from Seb with a question on 'add role to a user'
I don’t seems to see an ‘Add user’ option for new user in ‘User Setting” to the enrolled into the user group of role (Admin, developer, superuser, user)
Or are they manage by Authorisation like /USE/DSM3_ADMIN for DSM Administration to be added into a user profile?
Can you direct me to the right menu?
This is what I see – I was expecting to see a add/change/delete user options to assign respective role (Admin, developer, superuser,user)
Can you assist
Thanks

Dear,
is the customer using DSM4/DSM5 ?
As this is a pure knowledge transfer inquiry - wouldn´t this be a good case for a services person to involve? (billed time)
Thanks
N**** is on DSM3
Dear
Can you send us a screenshot of the DSM's About Screen:
start DSM transaction -> About -> About and send us the screenshot.
Thanks and regards,
