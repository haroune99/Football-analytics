Ticket 1 Info request #54200 - Question about available transactions
I have attached a list of transactions that are available. I would like to understand what they all are in better detail. Some appear to be duplicates and it appears that maybe your company is trying to move toward more generic transactions instead of linking them to versions (like /USE/DSM3)
I searched my manuals for more details and was not able to find that information. This will be very useful because we have taken your default foundation roles and built our roles and we want to keep them current.
For example: What is the difference between /USE/DSM and /USE/DSM3

Thank you for logging the ticket on Client Central. We will get back to you shortly.

Dear
You are correct that we did indeed move towards generic transactions codes and removed the version (3) from them but we still included them as we need to support those customers who are used to using the older DSM3 transaction codes even though they may have moved to DSM4, e.g /USE/DSM3, /DSM3OD and /USE/DSM will all invoke DSM 4 Object Sync.
The transactions with LT are used by EPI-USE Labs Services personnel for System Landscape Optimization projects where they need to perform their Landscape Transformation activities .
Are their specific transaction codes in the spreadsheet where the Transaction Text is not sufficient and you require more information for?
Thanks and regards
EPI-USE Labs Global Support
I would like to understand which ones are identical
I also did try to update our roles correctly. For example: We tried to execute a data transfer after removing the DSM3 transactions. When we tried to execute DSM and process an action to bring down data this happens
"You are not authorized to use transaction /USE/DSM3_MON "
I either have to include all transactions or is this something that can be fixed in the code we have?

Ticket 2: Info request #141196 - Add Role to user
Hi Support
I received the following from Seb with a question on 'add role to a user'
I don’t seems to see an ‘Add user’ option for new user in ‘User Setting” to the enrolled into the user group of role (Admin, developer, superuser, user)
Or are they manage by Authorisation like /USE/DSM3_ADMIN for DSM Administration to be added into a user profile?
Can you direct me to the right menu?
This is what I see – I was expecting to see a add/change/delete user options to assign respective role (Admin, developer, superuser,user)
Can you assist
Thanks

Dear,
is the customer using DSM4/DSM5 ?
As this is a pure knowledge transfer inquiry - wouldn´t this be a good case for a services person to involve? (billed time)
Thanks
N**** is on DSM3
Dear
Can you send us a screenshot of the DSM's About Screen:
start DSM transaction -> About -> About and send us the screenshot.
Thanks and regards,

Ticket 3: Info request #58019 - Enable authorization for DMS on DEV & QA
SAP BASIS team has asked me to enable authorization for DMS on DEV & QA, Please advise on the DSM roles that needs to be assigned to SAP Basis team to test authorization of DMS on Dev and QA.
Dear 
Thank you for logging the ticket on Client Central.
Please see more information on Authorizations in the DSM4 Installation and Admin guide, Section 4 page 17-36 - DSM 4 Installation and Administration Guide
I am sending you more information on the DSM Authorization Roles.
Each of the DSM products has layers of functionality. These layers of functionality are categorized into specific roles that will be assumed by a SAP user. The roles are defined within the product. These SAP users are SAP Dialog users and are referred to as Developers, Administrators, Super Users and Users. These roles are enforced by SAP authorizations.
DSM introduces an additional three authorization objects into your environment: Z123456; Z5948428; and Z0590589. These authorization objects are used to restrict functionality to the DSM product components. These authorization objects will not be part of your existing SAP_ALL user profile unless they are specifically added.
The following Authorization Profile Templates are delivered as part of DSM to assist in the setting up of authorization roles for users of DSM. To see the list of templates, please execute transaction PFCG. Then access the ‘Utilities’ menu and select ‘Templates’ from the drop-down list. You will see a popup with the templates included in DSM.
Technical name:
/USE/vovbneoj3ve: Data Sync Manager – Administrator
/USE/PfhvbeiberifeE: Data Sync Manager – Developer
/USE/Pnjfvfkbve: Data Sync Manager – Object Sync User
/USE/PbjkvbfkjvE: Data Sync Manager – Object Sync Super User
/USE/PjkdfbvfdjkE: Data Sync Manager – Client Sync User
/USE/Pjkvbfkjevb: Data Sync Manager – Data Secure User
/USE/Pnvjflnvfs: Data Sync Manager – Data Secure Super User
/USE/Pjkfbvkvdv: Data Sync Manager – System Builder User
/USE/Pbvhfvbfbv: Data Sync Manager - iPhone App
/USE/nvjfnjvve: Data Sync Manager – Object Sync DSM3COMM user authorizations
Please let us know if you have more questions or need further assistance.
Kind regards

Dear,
I have executed transaction code PFCG to see the list of templates on QA and I did manage to see the templates:
My question is are these templates working like roles? can they be assigned to users so that the user can execute on DSM some of the transaction code like: /USE/DSM and /USE/DSM3 . At the moment the Basis person is not able to execute these transactions codes so I am wondering if they have access to this
regards
Dear 
A user will need one of the DSM roles in order to access DSM. On page 14 of the DSM 4 Installation and Administration Guide the roles and their functions are outlined. You can use these descriptions to determine which DSM role the Basis team needs. Usually the Basis team has the Administrator and Client Sync User role.
Please let us know if you have other questions.
Kind regards
